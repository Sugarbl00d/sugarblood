# Who I Am
Well, I guess I should probably introduce myself, or you may not end up trusting what I have to say. The name is Jared Saye, but I've gone by Sugarblood online for many years. I'm a 24 year old fresh college graduate still waiting on an employment opportunity. I just graduated from The University of Alabama (Roll Tide!) with an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I also received my CompTIA Security+ certification the same week I got my masters degree due to some poor planning on my part.

# What I Do
There really isn't a simple answer I can come up with for the question of what I do because what I'm doing and working on tend to change rapidly over time. Overall, I'm a big tech nerd. I like pretty much anything tech related, and if I don't already, it wouldn't take much convincing to get me there. 
- Homelab
- Cybersecurity
- AI/ML
- Robotics
- Electronics
- 3D Printing

Most recently, besides figuring out this website, I've been working on setting up my general purpose homelab to host services I use. This will probably be the reigning topic for the time being as it is what I am currently working on.

I also delve into cybersecurity topics because I really like the idea of owning what you have, but also breaking things in such a way that it produces a useful outcome for me. Not only do the normal topics interest me (Wi-Fi, WebApp, Reverse Engineering, etc.), but I also am very interested in hardware hacking. As an electrical engineer on top of a computer scientist, this area of research is especially interesting. 

These days, the term "AI" usually means Large Language Models (LLMs). When I say I'm interested in AI/ML, these are included as a subcategory, but there are so many other parts of the AI/ML space that are just as interesting or useful in there own ways. Object recognition, search algorithms, game adversaries are just a few examples of some more interesting applications. Most of the actual work I *~~will~~* hope to do with AI and ML will be with robotics.

I believe in the humanoid robotics revolution, and I want to be a part of it. However, for now, this interest of mine is on the back burner. My best friend has some really cool robotics-related content over at [OverMyHead](https://www.youtube.com/@kindaovermyhead) on YouTube.

As for electronics projects, most of the ones I hope to do in the near future revolve around hardware hacking. As time goes on, I want to also begin learning more about the electronics involved in robotics, power generation, and much more.

Finally, one of my most recent hobbies I've started to adopt is 3D printing. About a month ago, I got my first 3D printer, a Bambu Labs A1 with the AMS system. I have avoided learning how to use any CAD software, so I am at a slight disadvantage when it comes to customizing prints for myself, but I have had fun so far finding prints online I like or have a use for. I do hope to learn more about 3D modeling to be able to design custom devices for myself.

# Future Plans
For this website, I'm thinking I'll post tutorials on how to install different services for a homelab, discuss my journey learning how to participate in bug bounty, my experiences with different local LLMs, and other various projects.

Having been coding for just about 10 years now, I have always wanted to contribute to the open source community because I use a lot of the free software they have created. Due to inexperience with OSS development, I will try to find a smaller piece of software with fewer contributors to try my hand at.

Overall, I hope I can use this website as a place to leave a roadmap for myself to rebuild everything I use from nothing. I also hope to explore topics that interest me in any field. At the most base level right now, my main goal for this website is to inspire myself to do more.

I hope I provided you with some sort of value from this website if you're here. With any luck, there will be one person who is out there that learns something from me that helps them. Good luck out there, I know it's tough.
