      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-i-am&#34;&gt;Who I Am&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I should probably introduce myself, or you may not end up trusting what I have to say. The name is Jared Saye, but I&amp;rsquo;ve gone by Sugarblood online for many years. I&amp;rsquo;m a 24 year old fresh college graduate still waiting on an employment opportunity. I just graduated from The University of Alabama (Roll Tide!) with an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I also received my CompTIA Security+ certification the same week I got my masters degree due to some poor planning on my part.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
